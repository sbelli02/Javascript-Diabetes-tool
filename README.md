WE've been required to develop a basic diabetes tool that calculate the risk level (as a numeric value), and display a message
based on the level of risk determined by the program.
If a user is assessed as being high risk, then they are prompted via the risk
message they receive to contact the Zedland Health Authority by means of a
contact form. The form in question should be on a second HTML page. It should
have the following fields and controls.
